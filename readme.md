### About the project -- Snake Game

Description:

The snake game has three level, with 1 the lowest and 3 the highest. Player can move the snake by left and right arrow key.
More instructions can be seen once the game is started.

For the snake and the fruit, I fill the circle with some pictures I find online to fill it to make the game look better.
